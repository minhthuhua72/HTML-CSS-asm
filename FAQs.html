                <h3 id="c5"><span>Why is my order late?</span></h3>
                <p>We always aim to deliver your order within our standard delivery times, but sometimes unexpected
                    factors can cause delays in your delivery. Here are some reasons your delivery might be late:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your order was shipped during our sales and promotions season.</li>
                    <li>You ordered more than one product. In exceptional circumstances your order may arrive in
                        different packages and on different dates.</li>
                    <li>Your order was placed during a local public holiday.</li>
                    <li>There were unpredictable circumstances beyond our control.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="c6"><span>Can I deliver goods out of VietNam?</span></h3>
                <p>Our online shop will only ship within Vietnam.</p>

                <h3 id="c7"><span>Why was my online order cancelled</span></h3>
                <p>Sometimes we have to cancel orders. This can be due to a number of reasons, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock availability. It is most likely that your size ran out of stock before we could process
                        your order.</li>
                    <li>Payment issues. Your payment did not go through or we were not able to verify your payment
                        details.</li>
                    <li>Delivery address issues. You may have accidentally entered an incorrect or incomplete delivery
                        address which we couldnâ€™t process.</li>
                    <li>You will not be charged for cancelled products. If your order, or part of it, is cancelled, you
                        will be refunded for the cancelled products.</li>
                    <li>In order to get a clear understanding why your order was cancelled we recommend you to contact
                        our online shop customer service team and they will be able to assist you.</li>
